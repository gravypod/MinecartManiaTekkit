I am maintaining Minecart Mania for use on my own Bukkit server. NethRar, Lockette, LWC and WormholeXtreme support is not in my version at the moment, all other features as well as all new items are supported.

This plugin was originally developed by Afforess but he stopped working on it a while ago.
